The psychic genes bug me. Based on my mod releases a lot of genes bug me, but psychic genes deserve a special mention right next to delicate and extra pain, amongst others that follow that pattern. Well this mod aims to fix this by doing two things. First, traits are gone and replaced by stats, so now you can give your people double psychic dullness. Second, it adds more options for psychic enhancements that follow the same pattern as the two you can have by default.

An example of following the same pattern, psy-sensitive gives +10% sensitivity for 2 points, well now you can get 5% for 1. That's a .5 for .5 value!

What, did you think I was going to give you a 2 for 1 promotional value?
